# 06-04: Learning Loop & Live Monitor

**Goal**: "Human-in-the-loop" interface for reviewing learning candidates and real-time monitoring of active calls.

**Depends on**: 06-01, Phase 5 (Candidate generation)

## Requirements
- **Learning Loop**: List candidates from Phase 5 (`candidates:knowledge`). 
    - **Actions**: Approve (add to KB), Reject (delete), Edit (modify answer then add).
- **Live Monitor**: See active calls in real-time context.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend API & WebSocket
- `GET /api/learning/candidates`: List pending candidates.
- `POST /api/learning/candidates/{id}/approve`: Move to KB.
- `POST /api/learning/candidates/{id}/reject`: Remove.
- `WebSocket /ws/dashboard`: Broadcast call states (Started, tool usage, Ended).

### 2. Frontend Components
- `pages/Learning.tsx`: List of cards/rows.
    - Each card shows Question, Proposed Answer, Confidence, Source Call ID.
    - Buttons: Approve, Reject, Edit.
- `components/LiveMonitor.tsx`: Floating widget or sidebar section showing "Active Calls: 1".

## Verification
- **Manual**:
    1. Generate a candidate via `worker.py` (mock or real call).
    2. Go to Learning page. Approve it.
    3. Verify it appears in Knowledge page and is searchable by bot.
