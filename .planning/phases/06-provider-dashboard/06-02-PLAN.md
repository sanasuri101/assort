# 06-02: Dashboard Home & Call History

**Goal**: Implement the main Dashboard view with metrics and the Call History view with detailed transcript visualization.

**Depends on**: 06-01, Phase 5 (for Call outcomes)

## Requirements
- **Dashboard Home**: Cards for "Total Calls Today", "Resolution Rate", "Avg Duration". Chart (Area/Bar) for call volume.
- **Call History**: Filterable table (Date, Outcome, Duration, Caller).
- **Transcript Viewer**: Visual flow representation (User said -> Bot tool call -> Bot said). not just text blocks.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend API (`app/api/dashboard.py`)
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats`: Aggregated metrics from Redis/DB.
- `GET /api/dashboard/calls`: List of recent calls.
- `GET /api/dashboard/calls/{call_id}`: Detailed call info + transcript + metadata.

### 2. Frontend Components
- `pages/Dashboard.tsx`: Uses Recharts for visualization.
- `pages/Calls.tsx`: DataTable for calls.
- `pages/CallDetail.tsx`: 
    - **Visual Flow**: Map transcript segments to UI nodes.
    - `ToolCallNode`: Shows which tool was called and result (Success/Fail).
    - `VerificationNode`: Shows identity check status.

## Verification
- **Manual**: 
    1. Make a few test calls (success, fail, abandon).
    2. Check Dashboard stats update.
    3. Open Call Detail. Verify flow visually represents the tool usage (e.g., identity verification step).
